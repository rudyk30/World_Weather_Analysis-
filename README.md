# Overview 

After completing the initial analysis for V. Isualize, the purpose of this project was to analyze how the data differs by city type. This analysis was completed by utilizing Pandas, Matplotlib and Python. 


## Results 

After creating a new summary data frame, it enabled us to understand the differences between each city type in a variety of metrics. 

## Summary Data
The Urban city type has significantly more total rides when compared to Rural and Suburban city types. Rural cities had the least amount of total rides, specifically 1500 less than Urban cities. Urban cities have the most total drivers by a staggering amount. Urban cities have 2,327 more drivers than Rural cities. The Average Fare per Ride is lowest in Urban cities, while Rural cities have the highest Average Fare per Ride. Rural cities have the highest Average Fare per Driver, while Urban cities have the lowest.

## Total Fare by City Type

From the graph above, we can clearly see Urban cities have the highest total fares, with Suburban and Rural cities trailing behing significantly. The peak price for a fare seems to be in early March for Urban cities. Suburban cities see a large spike in total fares in early April, while rural cities fare prices spike in April. All cities except for Surburban cities see fare prices stagnate or delcine after April. 


## Summary

After reviewing the data, below are 3 business recommendations I believe will help address disparities between city types

 1. There are more Urban city drivers than rides which indicates there isn't enough demand for rides and drivers cannot find work. One way to bridge the gap between rides and drivers can be to invest in aggressive marketing and advertising strategies by targeting urban city citizens to generate demand for ordering PyBer rides. From the Total Fare by City type graph, I recommend starting the advertising campaign at the end of February as that is the timeframe just before a peak in demand. 

 2. The Average Fare per Ride and Driver are both significantly higher in Rural cities than Suburban and Urban. This is due to rural cities being generally farther away from city centers or popular destinations such as shopping malls, movie theaters and sports arenas. PyBer can offer Urban residents a limited discount on rides for destinations greater than 10 miles away. This will increase the total amount of rides and will consequentially drive down the price per ride. 

 3. Another way to increase the amount of drivers in Rural areas is to hold a career event or do another advertising campaign highlighting the benefits of being a PyBer driver. This will increase the amount of drivers and therefore decrease the proce per ride and driver.
